# Trend Analyzer for the ASX
(Side note: Sift through the headings to find the progression, it will be labled "Progress")

## Overview

Trend Analyzer for the ASX is a Flask-based web application developed to assist users in analysing Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) companies using news sentiment, financial risk analysis, statistical calculations, historical records, graphical trend visualisation, and AI-generated insights.

The application retrieves current news articles related to a selected ASX company, performs automated sentiment and risk analysis, calculates a Prediction Sureness Score, stores results in an SQLite database, generates historical trend graphs, and allows users to query previous analyses using the Grok AI API.

This project was developed using a modular architecture to improve readability, maintainability, scalability, and ease of future development.

## Installation
```
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory containing:

```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key

GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_api_key
```

4. Download the TextBlob language data:

```
python -m textblob.download_corpora
```

5. Run the application:

```
python app.py
```

6. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Or whaterver your local host is, when you run step 5 on powershell [VScode] it should tell you what to search. 
```

```
## Trouble shooting
```
- I will be testing the running in all sorts of ways, if I find any faults I can't fix that may need the user to debug on their side, I will include it here.

## Progress:
(All unlabeled should be assumed as not ready yet)

```
## How It Works
```
1. The user enters an ASX ticker.
2. The application retrieves recent news articles.
3. Sentiment analysis and risk analysis are performed.
4. A Prediction Sureness Score is calculated.
5. Results are saved to the SQLite database.
6. Historical statistics and trend graphs are generated.
7. Users can review previous analyses or ask AI questions based on stored data.
